# Castagne
Castagne allows you to make fighting games more easily. It is a layer built upon Godot that manages the internal logic needed, so that you can focus on making the game itself.

# Current Status : Castagne v0.4 (preview)
The project is stable, but still a bit incomplete. Some small changes in behaviour may still happen as potential bugs are fixed.
Castagne v0.4 still needs the documentation to be complete, but the code is already good.
Rollback worked with Castagne v0.2, it will certainly need a second pass now that the refactoring is done.

Next version is going to be Castagne v0.5, [see the roadmap](http://panthavma.com/articles/castagne-roadmap-v1) for details.
It's main improvement is going to be the editor, which is probably going to take a while.

Most of the development of Castagne will follow the development of Kronian Titans itself.
