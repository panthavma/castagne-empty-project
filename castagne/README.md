# Castagne
Castagne allows you to make fighting games more easily. It is a layer built upon Godot that manages the internal logic needed, so that you can focus on making the game itself.

# Current Status
The project is currently still unstable, and will be until I implement rollback netcode, as it might cause some internal architecture shifts. Castagne is however still usable to start making a local multiplayer fighting game, albeit with some of the more graphical aspects missing.

Most of the development of Castagne will follow the development of Kronian Titans itself.

# Setup
- Copy the whole folder into your godot folder
- Copy project.godot to the root of your project (or use its adjustments)
- Add .casp files to your build


# Projects Using Castagne
- Kronian Titans
