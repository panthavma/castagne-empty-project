# Castagne
Castagne allows you to make fighting games more easily. It is a layer built upon Godot that manages the internal logic needed, so that you can focus on making the game itself.

# Current Status : Castagne v0.3
The project is still stabilizing, but it should be good enough to start. Some small changes in behaviour may happen as potential bugs are fixed.
I managed to make rollback work, but won't come back to it until Castagne v0.4 is done.

Next version is going to be Castagne v0.4, [see the roadmap](http://panthavma.com/articles/castagne-roadmap-v1) for details.

Most of the development of Castagne will follow the development of Kronian Titans itself.

# Setup
- Copy the whole folder into your godot folder
- Copy project.godot to the root of your project (or use its adjustments)
